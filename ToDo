----------------------------------------------------------
First Solution: using the "Amazon Product Advertising API"
----------------------------------------------------------
!!!I need to get Access Keys in order to make requests to the Amazon Product Advertising API!!!
needed => (access_key_id, secret_key, associate_tag, marketplace_correspondant) 

Done:
    - Create an amazon account
    - Create an amazon associates account https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/
    - Make more than three purchase + increase number of clicks : to get authorized to join/use Amazon Product Advertising API
    - Wait !!!!
    - Email Amazon.com Associate Support & Wait !!! 

Blocked
    - Sign up as a Product Advertising API developer based the locale

ToDo 
    IF (I'm authorized to use Amazon Product Advertising API):
        - Create New Access keys
        - Explore the "Amazon Product Advertising API"
        - understand how to use ItemLookup (it seems to be solution  in our case to search for an item based on an identifier such as ASIN)
        - Do the server code side & use the Amazon Product Advertising API

    ELSE:
        - Mock the Amazon Product Advertising API : create a fake server sending back a json response with needed app info from amazon
        - do the server code side & use the Mocked API instead of Amazon Product Advertising API


---------------------------------------
Second Solution: using the Web Scraping
---------------------------------------
!!!I'm not convinced to use the web scraping  in production because it can be frustrating when site just makes a subtle change on its layout!!!
I'm using it because I did not get the authorisation yet to use the Amazon Product Advertising API

Done:
    - coding
    - testing (unit, QA, Prod)
    - Deployment on Heroku

ToDo:
    - Document code by adding more unittests
    - Code cleaning/Refactoring
    -
